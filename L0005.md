## Computer Vision Task

The purpose of this lesson is to become familiar with computer vision libraries.
From the past we change a little bit the format of the test to improve the software architecture
skills.

- Every Task should be a class in python.
- Every subtask should be a function of the class.


### Task 1: Image Processing

Read and Display Image:
- Read the image named "Chess_board.jpg" using OpenCV.
- Display the image. 
- Convert Image to Grayscale
- Display the grayscale image.
- Apply Gaussian blur to the grayscale image with a kernel size of 5x5.
- Display the blurred image.


### Task 2: Image Manipulation
Image Rotation:
- Rotate the original image by 45 degrees clockwise.
- Display the rotated image.

Image Thresholding:
- Apply binary thresholding to the original image.
- Display the thresholded image.
- 
### Task 3: Line Detection and Cross Identification

Line Detection:
- Use the Hough Line Transform to detect lines in the grayscale image.
- Draw the detected lines on the original image.
- Display the image with detected lines.

Cross Identification:
- Implement a function to identify crosses formed by the intersection of lines.
- Draw circles or rectangles around the identified crosses.
- Display the image with marked crosses.

 
### Task 4: Image Features

Corner Detection:

- Use the Shi-Tomasi corner detection to find corners in the grayscale image.
- Mark the detected corners on the original image.
- Display the image with marked corners. 

Histogram Calculation:
- Calculate and plot the histogram of pixel intensities for the grayscale image.
