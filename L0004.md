## Scipy / scikit-learn (example003) 

The purpose of this lesson is to become familiar with the Scipy and scikit-learn libraries, commonly used for statistical analysis and machine learning model building. In particular, you will need to implement the following functions:

Consider toys dataset as reference to performe more experiments (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html)

### Task 0: Statistical Analysis

The function `task000()` performs statistical analysis:
- Generate two normal distributions with different means and standard deviations, each containing 100 elements, taking care of the "seed" of the random number generators.
- Conducting a t-test to compare two groups and calculate the associated p-value.
- Determine whether the p-value is significant or not

### Task 1: Visualizing and Analyzing the Digits Dataset

The function `task001()` loads the Digits dataset, visualizes some images, and provides basic statistics:

- Load the Digits dataset.
- Visualize some images from the dataset, displaying 10 handwritten digits.
- Print some basic statistics:
  - Number of samples in the dataset.
  - Number of features per sample.
  - Number of classes in the dataset.
  - Class distribution in the dataset.



### Task 2: Feature Engineering and Model Building

The function `task002()` focuses on feature engineering and model building:

- Loading a dataset of iris flowers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
- Create a scatter plot of the iris dataset with the first two features as the x and y coordinates, respectively. Points are colored based on the species of iris, and a legend is added to indicate the classes.
- Preprocessing the data.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training a decision tree classifier to predict flower species.

### Task 3: Clustering

The function `task003()` performs clustering using scikit-learn on a synthetic blobs dataset:
- Generates synthetic blobs dataset.
- Applies K-Means clustering.
- Visualizes the clustering result.

### Task 4: Dimensionality Reduction

The function `task004()` demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using scikit-learn:
- Loads the Iris dataset.
- Standardizes the features.
- Applies PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 2 dimensions.
- Visualizes the transformed data in the new feature space.

### Task 5: Classification and Model Evaluation

The function `task005()` loads the Iris dataset, preprocesses the data, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance on training and testing sets:
- Loads the Iris dataset.
- Creates a scatter plot.
- Preprocesses the data.
- Trains a logistic regression model.
- Evaluates the model's performance.

### Task 6: Classification and ROC Curve

The function `task006()` loads the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, preprocesses the data, trains a logistic regression model, and plots the ROC curve:
- Loads the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.
- Preprocesses the data.
- Trains a logistic regression model.
- Plots the ROC curve to evaluate the model's performance.

### Task 7: (to be completed)
