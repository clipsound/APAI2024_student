### Assignment: Image Color Space Conversion and Visualization

Create a Python function that processes an image by converting it to different color spaces and displays the results as a mosaic.

**Function Requirements:**
1. Read an image file from the provided path.
2. Convert the image from BGR color space to RGB, HSV, LAB, and YCrCb color spaces using OpenCV.
3. Resize the images in each color space for visualization purposes.
4. Create a mosaic by concatenating the resized images horizontally.
5. Display the mosaic image to show the original image in different color spaces.


## Task 1
### Assignment: Image Processing Function

Create a Python function that processes an image to highlight green areas and display the results in a mosaic format.

**Function Requirements:**
1. Read an image file from the provided path.
2. Convert the image from BGR color space to HSV color space.
3. Identify green areas in the image based on predefined color thresholds.
4. Highlight the green areas by creating a mask and applying it to the image.
5. Draw rectangles around significant green areas to emphasize them.
6. Resize the original image, mask, and processed images for visualization.
7. Create a mosaic by arranging the resized images horizontally.
8. Display the mosaic image to show the original image, mask, green areas, and processed image.


## Task 2
### Image Enhancement in LAB Color Space

Create a Python function that enhances an image in LAB color space and displays the results in a mosaic format.

**Function Requirements:**
1. Read an image file from the provided path.
2. Convert the image from BGR color space to LAB color space using OpenCV.
3. Split the LAB image into its L, a, and b channels.
4. Apply histogram equalization to each channel (L, a, and b) separately using OpenCV's `cv2.equalizeHist`.
5. Merge the enhanced channels back into an LAB image and convert it to BGR color space.
6. Resize the original image and the enhanced LAB images for visualization purposes.
7. Create a mosaic by concatenating the resized images horizontally.
8. Display the mosaic image to show the original image and the enhanced LAB channels (L, a, and b).


## Task Description
### Assignment: Multi-Channel Image Processing and Face Detection

Create a Python function that processes an image in multiple color spaces and detects faces, displaying the results in a mosaic format.

**Function Requirements:**
1. Create a Python function named `process_image_and_detect_faces` that takes the path of an image as input.
2. Read the image and convert it to different color spaces: YCrCb, LAB, and HSV using OpenCV.
3. Extract specific channels from each color space: Cr channel from YCrCb, L channel from LAB, and V channel from HSV.
4. Apply Gaussian blur to each extracted channel using OpenCV's `cv2.GaussianBlur`.
5. Use a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for face detection (`cv2.CascadeClassifier`) to detect faces in each blurred channel.
6. Draw rectangles around detected faces on the corresponding channel images.
7. Resize the channel images with detected faces for visualization.
8. Create a mosaic by concatenating the resized channel images horizontally.
9. Display the mosaic image to show face detection results in different color spaces.
