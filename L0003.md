## Support for data and Plotting library

The scope of this lesson is to write a Python code generates a CSV file and a pandas dataframe containing random data and creates a histogram of the age distribution of the generated data.

Here's what the code needs to implement:

1. It defines several utility functions to generate random values:
   - `generate_random_value(options_list)`: returns a random value from a list of options.
   - `generate_random_numeric_value(min_value, max_value)`: returns a random numeric value within a specified range.
   - `generate_uid()`: generates a random UID (Unique Identifier) of 8 characters, combining letters and numbers.
   
2. The `generate_csv_file(file_name, num_rows, columns)` function generates a CSV file with a specified number of rows (`num_rows`) and columns (`columns`). The column values are randomly generated using the utility functions defined earlier.

3. The `generate_dataframe(num_rows, columns)` function generates a pandas dataframe with a specified number of rows (`num_rows`) and columns (`columns`). Again, column values are randomly generated using the utility functions defined earlier.

4. In the `main()` function, the `generate_dataframe()` function is called to create a dataframe, and then the data is saved to a CSV file and a pickle file. A portion of the dataframe data is also displayed.

5. Finally, a histogram is created using `matplotlib.pyplot.hist()` to visualize the age distribution of the generated data in the dataframe.

When you run the code, it will create a CSV file named `generated_data.csv`, a pickle file named `generated_data_from_dataframe.pkl`, and it will display a histogram of the age distribution of the generated data.

## Numpy 


The purpose of this lesson is to become familiar with the numpy library, which is widely used for any task involving numerical processing. 
In particular, you will need to implement the following functions:

### Task 0: Basic Operation

The function `task000()` demonstrates basic operations with numpy arrays:

- Creating arrays filled with zeros, ones, or empty.
- Manipulating arrays: transposing, performing mathematical operations like sum, mean, and element-wise square root.
- Indexing and selection of elements.
- Linear algebra operations like matrix multiplication.
- Transforms such as the Discrete Fourier Transform.
- Random number generation from uniform and normal distributions.

### Task 1: Matrix Operations

The function `task001()` performs matrix operations:

- Definition and manipulation of matrices.
- Operations like sum, product, difference, and element-wise division of matrices.

### Task 2: Data Analysis

The function `task002()` focuses on data analysis:

- Loading a dataset of housing prices.
- Calculating descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- Visualizing the data using histograms.
- Preprocessing the data.

### Task 3: Usage of FFT for Signal Processing

The function `task003()` demonstrates the usage of FFT for signal processing:

- Generating a sinusoidal signal with random noise.
- Computing the Fourier Transform of the signal.
- Visualizing the signal and its Fourier Transform.

### Task 4: SQUEEZE Function

The function `task004()` introduces the `squeeze()` function:

- Creating arrays and tensors with dimensions of size 1.
- Using the `squeeze()` function to remove dimensions of size 1.

### Task 5: Data Exchange between Numpy and Other Library

The function `task005()` shows how to exchange data between numpy and another library (PIL):

- Creating a sample image in RGBA format using numpy.
- Saving the image and modifying the original data.
- Saving the modified image, demonstrating data sharing between numpy and PIL.

Each task demonstrates various functionalities of numpy, including basic operations, matrix operations, data analysis, signal processing, and data exchange with other libraries.
